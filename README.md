# LookerConnect

A Flutter Project made for the CloudBI Hackathon 2022.

This is a Looker Admin Console for iOS and Android. Here, you're going to be able to do the following:
* Search Users by User ID.
* See all Models
* See all User Attributes
* See Connections
* See Users
* See Dashboards
* See Looks

Is an on-going process, but works as a proof of concept for the abilities to have an app for Looker Admins.
